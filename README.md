# LangGraph

- [x] Get boilerplate done and study the different objects by printing them all
- [x] Make a drawing to start in order to get our project plan
- [x] Read more the documentation in order to understand different objects
- [ ] Do more of the tutorial to have a feel of different way to use it and print the output to familiarize with the different objects
- [ ] From experience gathered, start thinking of a custom graph that you want to create. You should be able to make a simple one and then complicate it along the way
- [ ] Be creative and create your tutorial on an interesting use case

### Tips:
- For the learning curve, take the habit to print the states after every `nodes` in order to understand what has been updated in the state
