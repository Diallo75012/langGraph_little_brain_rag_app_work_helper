'''This file contains the documentation in how to write a mardown Python script to make API to satisfy user request.Make sure that the script is having the right imports, indentations, uses Python standard libraries and do not have any error before starting writing it.'''

"{\n  \"documentation\": \n  \"To write a Python script that calls an API to get jokes, follow these steps:\n\n**Step 1: Import the `requests` library**\nImport the `requests` library at the top of your script using the `import` statement. This library is used to make HTTP requests to the API.\n\n**Step 2: Define a function to get a random joke**\nDefine a function, e.g., `get_random_joke()`, that makes a GET request to the API using the `requests.get()` method. The API URL is `https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/random_joke`.\n\n**Step 3: Parse the JSON response**\nParse the JSON response from the API using the `response.json()` method. This will give you a Python dictionary containing the joke data.\n\n**Step 4: Extract the joke setup and punchline**\nExtract the joke setup and punchline from the JSON data using dictionary keys. In this case, the keys are `setup` and `punchline`.\n\n**Step 5: Format the joke into a readable string**\nFormat the joke into a readable string using an f-string. This will give you a nicely formatted joke with a setup and punchline.\n\n**Step 6: Call the function and print the result**\nCall the `get_random_joke()` function and print the result using the `print()` function.\n\n**Step 7: Save and run the script**\nSave the script as a `.py` file and run it using Python to get a random joke.\n\nHere's the complete script:"
