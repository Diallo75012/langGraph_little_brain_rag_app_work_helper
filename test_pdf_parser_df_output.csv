9013bf40-f451-4033-8c65-2950c5885e69,docs/feel_temperature.pdf,Uncovering the biology of temperature perception,"Exploring the cellular and molecular mechanisms of temperature sensation goes beyond the average kinetic energy of substances. While fast-moving molecules equate to heat and slow-moving ones to cold, understanding how the brain senses and relays temperature information is key. When you touch an ice cube, your brain interprets the cold sensation through specific temperature-sensitive neurons. These neurons convert temperature stimuli into electrical signals, which are then sent to the brain for processing. This complex process involves various ion channels and receptors, such as TRPM8 for cold and TRPV1 for heat. Ultimately, these signals allow us to regularly identify temperatures as cold, hot, or neutral.",False

They are not enclosed within a membrane, allowing them to detect physical stimuli through interactions with our skin. There are two types of thermoreceptors: cold and warm receptors, which can vary in concentration throughout the body. For example, the ears and face have a greater concentration of cold receptors, which is why they can feel excessively cold in the winter.",False
cc6e39cf-5318-457c-84f8-bad1a90fd0fb,docs/feel_temperature.pdf,'Frequency of Firing in Cold Thermoreceptors',"To understand FNE thermoreceptors, you need to know about neurotransmission. The brain's signal strength relies on neuron firing frequency. We interact with objects at room temperature, which causes normal firing rates in thermoreceptors. However, cold or hot stimuli alter the firing rate of their corresponding thermoreceptors.",False
fe088bca-f75d-4e97-92e9-3a1ea6848799,docs/feel_temperature.pdf,'Neural Responses: Feeling Hot and Cold Temperatures',"Perception of temperature is determined by the firing rates of cold and warm receptors. When touching an object between 5-30°C, cold receptor firing increases and warm receptor firing decreases, indicating cold. When touching an object between 30-45°C, warm receptor firing increases and cold receptor firing decreases, indicating warmth. If an object is hot enough to cause pain, nociceptors are activated, signaling pain and further indicating potential injury.",False

This sensation is often associated with a different type of heat, typically caused by inflammation or irritation of the skin or underlying tissues. It can be caused by various factors, such as exposure to chemicals, extreme temperatures, or certain medical conditions.

In contrast to the comfortable warmth of a hot tub or sauna, burning heat is usually painful and can indicate damage to the body. If you experience persistent or severe burning sensations, it's essential to seek medical attention to determine the underlying cause and receive appropriate treatment.",False

The TRPV1 receptor, also known as the ""warm receptor,"" is responsible for the burning sensation in the mouth when consuming spicy foods. When capsaicin binds to the TRPV1 receptor, it causes an influx of sodium and calcium into nerve cells, initiating the firing of associated nerves that signal to the brain that something is hot in the mouth. Similarly, TRPM8 receptors conduct messages about cold stimuli when cooling agents bind to the receptors. These receptors are examples of how the body can perceive changes in movements of small molecules through physical stimuli.",False
