573892ad-fae2-4fbb-9fb9-f36cfc68c170,feel_temperature.pdf,"""Unraveling Temperature Sensation Mechanisms""","1. Temperature sensation involves cellular and molecular mechanisms.
2. Sensing temperature is not just about kinetic energy of molecules.
3. When you touch something cold, receptors in your skin sense the temperature change.
4. This information is then sent to the brain through nerves as electrical signals.
5. The brain interprets these signals as ""cold"".",False

- Transcription creates mRNA from DNA template
- mRNA has codons (3-letter sequences) that specify amino acids
- Translation uses mRNA codons to build polypeptide chains
- Folding of polypeptide chains creates functional proteins",False

- Free nerve endings (FNE) in dermis
- Ganglions (receive info from stimuli) in mid-epidermis, no membrane
- 2 types: cold receptors, warm receptors
- Concentration varies throughout body, e.g., ears, face have more cold receptors",False

2. Thermoreceptors detect temperatures of substances/objects, usually at room temperature (normal firing rates).
3. Cold or hot stimuli change the firing rate of corresponding thermoreceptors.",False
